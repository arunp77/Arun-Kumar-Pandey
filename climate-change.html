                <li><strong>Causes of Climate Change</strong></li> 
                The main cause of climate change is human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These activities release 
                green house gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the Earth’s temperature to rise.
                
                <div class="box" style="background-color: rgb(255, 243, 243); border: 2px solid black;">
                    <strong>Green house gases:</strong> Greenhouse gases are the gases in the atmosphere that raise the surface temperature of planets such as the Earth. What 
                    distinguishes them from other gases is that they absorb the wavelengths of radiation that a planet emits, resulting in the greenhouse effect. The Earth is 
                    warmed by sunlight, causing its surface to radiate heat, which is then mostly absorbed by water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), 
                    methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface 
                    would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F) [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" target="_blank">Reference</a>].
                    (for Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion see the [<a href="https://www.metric-conversions.org/temperature/celsius-to-fahrenheit.htm" target="_blank">link</a>])
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>Green house effect:</strong> The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases in a planet's atmosphere trap some of the heat radiated from the 
                    planet's surface, raising its temperature. This process happens because stars emit shortwave radiation that passes through greenhouse gases, but planets 
                    emit longwave radiation that is partly absorbed by greenhouse gases. That difference reduces the rate at which a planet can cool off in response to being 
                    warmed by its host star. Adding to greenhouse gases further reduces the rate a planet emits radiation to space, raising its average surface temperature 
                    [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" target="_blank">Reference</a>].

                <li><strong>Impacts of Climate Change</strong></li>
                Climate change is already having a significant impact on our planet. The Earth’s average temperature has risen by about 1 degree Celsius since the 
                pre-industrial period. This may not seem like much, but it is enough to cause a range of changes, including:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Rising sea levels: </strong>As the Earth’s temperature rises, more water evaporates from the oceans. This water then returns to the 
                    Earth in the form of rain or snow, but some of it remains in the atmosphere as vapor. This causes the oceans to expand, and sea levels to rise.</li>
                  <li><strong>Extreme weather events: </strong>Climate change is causing more extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and wildfires. 
                    These events are having a devastating impact on communities around the world.</li>
                  <li><strong>Loss of biodiversity: </strong>Climate change is also hurting biodiversity. The Earth’s ecosystems are being disrupted, and many species are being lost.</li>
                </ul>
      
                <li><strong>Mitigation and Adaptation</strong></li> 
                There are two main approaches to addressing climate change:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Mitigation: </strong>Mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preventing further warming. This can be done by switching to 
                    renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and planting trees.</li>
                  <li><strong>Adaptation: </strong>Adaptation involves preparing for the impacts of climate change that are already happening. This can include building 
                    seawalls to protect coastal communities from rising sea levels and developing drought-resistant crops.</li>
                </ul>
              <li><strong>International Cooperation</strong></li>  
              Addressing climate change requires international cooperation. The <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement#:~:text=The%20Paris%20Agreement%20is%20a,force%20on%204%20November%202016." target="_blank">Paris Agreement</a>, adopted in 2015, is an international treaty that aims to limit global 
              warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. The agreement also aims to strengthen the 
              ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.
      
              <li><strong>Individual Actions</strong></li> 
              While international cooperation is essential, individual actions can also make a difference. There are many things that we can do as individuals to reduce 
              our carbon footprint and help to address climate change. These include:
              <ul>
                  <li>Driving less and walking, biking, or taking public transportation more often.</li>
                  <li>Using less energy at home by using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights when not in use, and taking shorter showers.</li>
                  <li>Eating less meat and more plant-based foods.</li>
                  <li>Reducing, reusing, and recycling.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong>Conclusion of the section</strong></li> 
              Climate change is a complex and challenging issue, but it is not insurmountable. With international cooperation, individual action, and technological innovation, 
              we can address climate change and build a more sustainable future.

        <h2>How to address the climate change</h2>
        Addressing climate change requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses mitigation, adaptation, and international cooperation. Here are some of the key strategies 
        currently being considered and implemented to curb the effects of climate change:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Renewable Energy Transition: </strong> 
                Transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and geothermal power, is crucial to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, the primary contributors 
                to greenhouse gas emissions. Governments and industries are investing heavily in renewable energy technologies to increase their share in the global energy mix.

                    <figcaption style="text-align: center;"></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Energy Efficiency and Conservatio: </strong>Improving energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industrial processes can significantly reduce 
                energy consumption and associated emissions. This involves adopting energy-efficient appliances, optimizing building designs, and promoting sustainable transportation options.
                <figure>

                    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Image created by AI technologies.</figcaption>
                </figure> 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): </strong>CCS technology captures carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial processes and stores them underground, 
                preventing them from entering the atmosphere. While CCS is not a standalone solution, it can complement other mitigation strategies to further reduce emissions.
            
            </li>
            <li><strong>Forest Conservation and Enhancement: </strong>Forests play a vital role in absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it in their biomass. Protecting existing 
                forests and promoting reforestation efforts can significantly enhance the natural carbon sink and contribute to mitigating climate change.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable Land Use Practices: </strong>Sustainable land use practices, such as minimizing deforestation, adopting regenerative agriculture, and conserving 
                natural habitats, can help conserve carbon and promote biodiversity, further enhancing climate resilience.</li>
            <li><strong>International Cooperation and Agreements: </strong>International cooperation is essential to address climate change on a global scale. The Paris Agreement, a 
                landmark international pact, outlines a global framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Awareness and Behavioral Change: </strong>In addition to policy and technological interventions, fostering public awareness and encouraging behavioral 
                changes are crucial to mitigating climate change. This includes promoting sustainable lifestyles, reducing consumption, and supporting climate-friendly policies. </li>

        <h2>International Cooperation and Agreements</h2>
        Addressing climate change requires concerted global action and international cooperation. Several important agreements have been established to guide and support international efforts to 
        mitigate and adapt to climate change. Here are some of the key international agreements:
        <ol>
            <li><strong><a href="https://unfccc.int/" target="_blank">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</a></strong>
                <p>Adopted in 1992, the UNFCCC is the primary international treaty addressing climate change. It establishes a framework for countries to cooperate in the reduction of 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions" target="_blank">greenhouse gas emissions</a> and the adaptation to the effects of climate change. The UNFCCC has been ratified by 197 parties, representing virtually every country in the world.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" target="_blank">Kyoto Protocol</a></strong>
                <p>The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997 and entered into force in 2005, is an international agreement that set legally binding emission reduction targets for industrialized 
                    countries. The protocol aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5% below 1990 levels over the period 2008-2012. However, the United States, the world's 
                    largest emitter at the time, never ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and some other major emitters also did not meet their targets.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement" target="_blank">Paris Agreement</a></strong>
                <p>The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is a landmark international agreement that aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change. It establishes a framework 
                    for countries to voluntarily set ambitious national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to accelerate their efforts to adapt to the effects of climate change. The Paris 
                    Agreement has been ratified by 196 parties, representing over 195 countries.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</a></strong>
                <p>The IPCC is an intergovernmental body established by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" target="_blank">World Meteorological Organization (WMO)</a> 
                    and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme" target="_blank">United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)</a> 
                    to provide the world with the most up-to-date scientific assessment of climate change. The IPCC assesses the physical science basis of climate change, its impacts, and the options for 
                    mitigation and adaptation. The IPCC's reports are considered authoritative sources of information on climate change and have informed many international agreements and policies.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/" target="_blank">Green Climate Fund</a></strong>
                <p>The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a financial mechanism established to support developing countries in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The GCF provides grants 
                    and concessional financing to developing countries to invest in clean energy, protect forests, and build resilience to climate change impacts. The GCF has received pledges of over 
                    $100 billion from developed countries, and it is expected to play a crucial role in supporting the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        These international agreements and initiatives provide a framework for international cooperation and action on climate change. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of climate 
        change, these agreements and institutions will play an increasingly important role in supporting global efforts to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate

        <h2>Working Group on Climate</h2>
        Working Group on Climate" can refer to two different organizations:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): </strong>
            The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It is a scientific body composed of hundreds of 
            experts from all over the world. The IPCC Working Group I (WGI) assesses the physical science basis of climate change. This includes understanding the Earth's climate system, 
            how it is changing, and the potential impacts of climate change.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Working Group on Energy and Climate Change of the Economic Policy Committee (EPC): </strong>
            The Economic Policy Committee (EPC) is an independent advisory body to the European Commission. The Working Group on Energy and Climate Change (WGEEC) of the EPC is responsible 
            for assisting and preparing the EPC's work on the economic and financial aspects of climate and energy policy, international climate policy, and the EU Energy Union.
